# Welcome! Thanks for visiting

I'm a physicist with a masters in applied physics and I'm all about learning and getting humbled in the process. With this spirit in mind I share with you the projects I've done and that I'm working on.


## Projects:
| Name | Status | P. Language | Description | Insight |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| CT Scan | Beautifying | Python |   |    |
| LIF NN | Beautifying | Python | In essence this project consisted in recreating and studying a network of biological neurons. this network contained two types of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons that comunicated with each other using different neurotransmiters. Thus the simulation had make the state of each neuron evolve in time taking into consideration the states of the other neurons and their type. I chose to take an OOP aproach that consisted in creating neuron objects that , inherited the propper parameters uppon creation, tracked their state variables as instanced attributes, and updated said values by simply calling upon a method.    |    |

| Reaction-Diffusion | Beautifying | Python |   |    |
| Chimera states | Beautifying | C++/Python |   |    |
